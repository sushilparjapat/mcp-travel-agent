- **`get_current_conditions`**: Retrieve current weather observations from nearby weather stations
- **`get_weather_forecast`**: Get daily or hourly weather forecasts for specific locations
- **`get_weather_alerts`**: Search for weather alerts by area, severity, urgency, and other filters
- **`get_weather_data_details`**: Retrieve detailed information from previous weather searches
- **`filter_forecast_by_conditions`**: Filter forecast data by temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions

### üìñ MCP Resources
- **`weather://searches`**: Browse all saved weather searches
- **`weather://{search_id}`**: Get detailed information about specific weather searches

### üéØ MCP Prompts
- **`weather_planning_prompt`**: Comprehensive weather planning for activities and events
- **`severe_weather_alert_prompt`**: Detailed severe weather monitoring and safety recommendations

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Claude Desktop application

### Setup

1. **Clone or create the project directory:**
```bash
mkdir weather-search-mcp
cd weather-search-mcp
```

2. **Create the server files:**
   - Save the main server code as `weather_search_server.py`
   - Save the pyproject.toml configuration
   - Save the server_config.json (update the path)

3. **Install dependencies using UV:**
```bash
uv install
```

4. **Configure Claude Desktop:**
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Developer
   - Edit your `server_config.json` file (typically located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS)
   - Update the `cwd` path in the configuration to point to your project directory

5. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new MCP server

## Configuration

### Server Config for Claude Desktop

Update your Claude Desktop configuration file with the correct path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather-search": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--python",
        "3.11",
        "weather_search_server.py"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/weather-search-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/your/weather-search-mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/weather-search-mcp` with the actual path to your project directory.

## Usage Examples

### Getting Current Weather Conditions

```
What's the current weather in San Francisco, California?
```

The server will:
1. Convert the location to coordinates (37.7749, -122.4194)
2. Find nearby weather stations
3. Retrieve current observations
4. Provide temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and other conditions

### Getting Weather Forecasts

```
Give me a 7-day forecast for Denver, Colorado with hourly details for tomorrow.
```

The server will:
1. Get location coordinates and grid information
2. Retrieve both daily and hourly forecasts
3. Present organized forecast data with temperatures, precipitation chances, and conditions

### Monitoring Weather Alerts

```
Check for any severe weather alerts in Kansas and provide safety recommendations.
```

The server will:
1. Query active alerts for Kansas (area=KS)
2. Analyze severity and urgency levels
3. Provide detailed safety recommendations

### Weather Activity Planning

```
Plan outdoor activities for next weekend in Austin, Texas. I'm considering hiking and barbecuing.
```

The server will use the weather planning prompt to:
1. Get comprehensive forecast data
2. Analyze conditions for outdoor activities
3. Recommend optimal timing for hiking and barbecuing
4. Suggest necessary preparations

## API Endpoints Used

The server utilizes the following National Weather Service API endpoints:

- **Points**: `https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}` - Location and grid information
- **Gridpoint Forecasts**: `https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast` - Daily forecasts
- **Hourly Forecasts**: `https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast/hourly` - Hourly forecasts
- **Observations**: `https://api.weather.gov/stations/{stationId}/observations/latest` - Current conditions
- **Alerts**: `https://api.weather.gov/alerts` - Weather alerts and warnings

## Data Storage

The server automatically saves all weather searches to the `weather_data/` directory as JSON files. This allows for:
- Historical weather data reference
- Filtering and analysis of past searches
- Caching to improve performance
- Data persistence across sessions

## Rate Limiting

The National Weather Service API has reasonable rate limits for typical use. The server includes:
- Proper User-Agent headers as required by NWS
- Error handling for rate limit responses
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Request timeout handling

## Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting
- Invalid coordinates or locations
- Missing or corrupted data
- File system errors

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv install --dev

# Run the server directly
uv run weather_search_server.py

# Run with debugging
PYTHONPATH=. uv run weather_search_server.py
```

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Format code
uv run black weather_search_server.py

# Sort imports
uv run isort weather_search_server.py

# Type checking
uv run mypy weather_search_server.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server not loading in Claude Desktop:**
   - Check that the `cwd` path in server_config.json is correct
   - Ensure UV is installed and accessible
   - Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes

2. **API request failures:**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify the National Weather Service API is accessible
   - Check for rate limiting (wait 5 seconds and retry)

3. **Location not found:**
   - Ensure coordinates are within the United States
   - Try different coordinate formats (decimal degrees)
   - Check that the location has nearby weather stations

### Debug Logging

The server includes console logging for debugging. Check the Claude Desktop logs or run the server directly to see detailed error messages.
