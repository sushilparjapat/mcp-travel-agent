## Development

### Project Structure
```
finance-search-server/
â”œâ”€â”€ finance_search_server.py    # Main server code
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml             # UV project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ finance/                   # Stored search results (created automatically)
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # This file
```

### Running Locally
```bash
# Run the server directly
uv run python finance_search_server.py

# Or activate the environment and run
uv shell
python finance_search_server.py
```

### Testing
```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv add --dev pytest black flake8

# Run tests (if you create them)
uv run pytest

# Format code
uv run black finance_search_server.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"SERPAPI_KEY environment variable is required"**
   - Make sure your SerpAPI key is set in the environment
   - Check the Claude Desktop config has the correct key

2. **"No finance search found with ID"**
   - The search ID doesn't exist or the file was deleted
   - Use `finance://searches` resource to list available searches

3. **Server not appearing in Claude**
   - Check the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is correct
   - Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
   - Check UV is installed and accessible

4. **API request failures**
   - Verify your SerpAPI key is valid and has remaining quota
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Some symbols may not be available in Google Finance

### Debugging
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/your/server"
export DEBUG=1
```
